# A-Star-Search-In-Mazes-Assignment
Assignment for my 3rd Year Intelligent Machines class

Assignment Rubric:

Familiarise yourself with the Python code for search and determine what needs to be provided to run the code. 
Then look at how the mazes are represented in the SCMP folder and how the starting and goal positions are represented.
Once you have completed this, extend the Python code so that it can search through a given maze.
To begin with, use depth-first search to find the goal in a given maze. 
Once you have a running depth-first search algorithm, use A* search instead. 
The cost for moving from one cell to another in the grid should be 1. 
Think about a suitable heuristic for this problem and add it to the A* search algorithm. 
You can assume that the heuristic knows the location of the goal in the maze.
For this assignment, you are supposed to deliver the following via Stream as a ZIP file:

• A general description of how the mazes are integrated into the search algorithms.
• A list of all functions that you have added to or changed in the code from AIPython, together with documen-
tation of these functions. Your documentation needs to be more detailed than just a few comments.
• A description of your heuristic and justification of why this is a suitable heuristic.
• Runtime traces for both depth-first search and A* search.
• An informal comparison of the runtime of both types of searches. Is A* search always faster than depth-first search?
